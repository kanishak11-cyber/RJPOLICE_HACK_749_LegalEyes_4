Objectives of the AI/ML System

Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Develop NLP algorithms to comprehend and extract crucial details from complainant-provided information.

Structured Data Representation:

Transform extracted information into a structured format for consistent and clear FIR generation.

Accuracy and Completeness:

Ensure the AI/ML system accurately captures all necessary information, minimizing errors and omissions in FIRs.

Multi-language Support:

Implement language-agnostic capabilities to support FIR drafting in multiple languages used within the jurisdiction.

Legal and Regulatory Compliance:

Design the system to adhere to important legal requirements and standard FIR formats specified by law enforcement agencies.

Background

When complaints are filed, FIRs are recorded with sections of IPC and other acts, but there's a challenge in understanding the multiplicity of acts. This can lead to accusations of applying the wrong or weaker sections of the law. AI can assist by suggesting relevant sections based on the language of the complaint, allowing investigators to probe accordingly.

Challenges

CCTNS Datasets Not Utilized: ML hasn't been applied to CCTNS datasets, limiting the use of FIRs available on Rajcop.
Local and Regional Language Datasets: FIR datasets are offered in local and regional languages, presenting a challenge for processing.
Desired Solution

A software or portal with the following features:

OCR Functionality: Capable of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for major Indian languages, starting with at least Hindi.
State-specific Rules: Incorporate state-specific local rules alongside CrPC and IPC for accurate section recommendations.
User Flexibility: Provide the IO or registering person with the option to choose applicable sections.
Speed and Accuracy: Improve speed and accuracy in FIR drafting, reducing manual workload for law enforcement officers.
Standardization: Ensure standardization and consistency in FIR content for better data analysis and investigative processes.
Transparency and Accountability: Enhance transparency and accountability in FIR registration, leading to time and resource savings.
Compatibility with CCTNS: Ensure compatibility with CCTNS for seamless integration.
Law Application Highlighting: Highlight applicable law sections for each statement or paragraph, aiding in training.
Additional Consideration

Once the major FIR head is identified (e.g., NDPS, crime against women), leverage open datasets, including case laws, circulars, and SOPs, for detailed investigations, thereby enhancing the quality of investigations.
